          <h2 class="article_title">45 free things to do in New York City</h2>
        </header>

        <section class="article_text">
          <p class="story"> Seeing New York City's biggest attractions can mean spending a hefty chunk of your trip budget on tickets. Empire State Building? $36. The Guggenheim and the Whitney both go for $25. Even the Frick is $22. But there's a lifetime of fun to be had without ever handing over a cent, and not just by taking on park trails, bike paths or window-shopping. (Plus, some ticket-admission spots have free entry times, too.)

          Thrifty New York travelers, get busy!

          African Burial Ground
          One of Lower Manhattan's most fascinating, and controversial, stories of recent years circulates around the new African Burial Ground National Monument site. It began when a construction project in 1991 uncovered a burial ground of slaves – more than 400 caskets were found – from an age when New York had more slaves than any American city outside Charleston, South Carolina. Outside you can see part of the site now enveloped by buildings, and the compact visitors center does a masterful job at retelling African-American history in the city. 290 Broadway between Duane & Elk Sts, Lower Manhattan.</p>

          <p class="story">It doesn't take brilliant travel minds to tell you that a park is free to visit – most parks are. But most parks aren't Central Park, Manhattan's famed claim to thinking ahead (even if it was designed in the 1860s to boost real-estate value uptown). It's filled with free events, statues, people-watching and sites like Strawberry Fields, an 'Imagine' mosaic near the Dakota, where John Lennon was killed in 1980. Another site is 'the Pond,' at the southeastern corner, where Holden Caulfield kept turning to in 'The Catcher in the Rye,' wondering where those ducks go when it's cold.

          Chelsea galleries
          New York's most concentrated area for a gallery crawl is in Chelsea, mostly in the 20s streets between 10th and 11th Avenues. Check Gallery Guide for listings. All galleries are free entry, with no pressure to buy. And try timing your visit for wine-and-cheese openings on Thursday evenings.</p>

          <p class="story">City Hall
          Home to New York City's government since 1812, City Hall is the oldest city hall in the USA that is still used for its original purpose. Tours take in its cupola-topped marble hall, the governor's room as well as the spot where Abraham Lincoln's coffin lay in state briefly in 1865 – make sure you reserve your spot in advance. City Hall Park, facing the Brooklyn Bridge, Lower Manhattan.

          Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) Museum
          It's always Fashion Week in the FIT Museum, which features rotating exhibits by students and a surprisingly interesting and detailed collection of the country's first gallery of fashion, picked from a collection of 50,000 garments dating from the 18th century to present. Seventh Ave & 27th St, Garment District, Midtown West.

           </p>

          <p class="story">Federal Hall
          Two presidents were inaugurated in New York City, beginning with the first 'Dubya' – George Washington – who took the oath in Federal Hall in 1789, back when New York was the first capital. (Chester A. Arthur was the second.) There's a nice statue outside, overlooking the New York Stock Exchange across Wall Street, and a small museum on post-colonial New York inside. 26 Wall St, Lower Manhattan.

          General Ulysses S Grant National Memorial (aka 'Grant's Tomb')
          Also called 'Grant's Tomb', the $600,000 granite structure that holds the remains of the Civil War hero and 18th president (and his wife Julia) is the largest mausoleum in the US, and is patterned after Mausolus' tomb at Halicarnassus, making it a plagiarized version of one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Riverside Dr at 122nd St, Morningside Heights.</p>

          <p class="story">Grand Central Partnership Walking Tours
          Two historians lead free 90-minute walking tours at 12:30pm every Friday, hitting places like Grand Central Terminal's 'whispering gallery' and the Chrysler Building. 120 Park Ave, at 42nd St, Midtown East.

          Green-Wood Cemetery
          Once the nation's most visited tourist attraction outside Niagara Falls, the gorgeous Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in 1838 and is the eternal home to some 600,000 people (or about 530 miles of bodies, head to toe). It's leafy and lovely, features Brooklyn's highest point at Battle Hill – a site from the Revolutionary War now marked with a seven-foot statue of the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. Watch for the squawking green parakeets at the cemetery's Gothic entry – these are runaways from a JFK mishap in 1980 and have lived here since. 500 25th St, Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

          Hamilton Grange
          You know you've made it when you get a grange (the next level unlocks when a hit Broadway musical is written about your life). Hamilton Grange reopened in 2011 after renovation and is the Federal-style country retreat where Alexander Hamilton spent quieter, pre-death-by-duel New York days. St Nicholas Park at 141st St, Hamilton Heights.
