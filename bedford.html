        <section class="article_text">
          <p class="story"> Bedford Avenue opened on June 30, 1924, as part of the initial segment of the underground Canarsie Line that originally stretched from Sixth Avenue station in Manhattan to Montrose Avenue station, built by the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) under the Dual Contracts.

          In 2019, as part of the wide scope in the rebuilding of the Canarsie Tubes that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will renovate the Bedford Avenue station. At the Bedford Avenue end of the station, two new street-level stairways will be built, platform stair capacity will be increased, the mezzanine will be expanded, turnstiles will be added, and new elevators will be built. At the Driggs Avenue end, two new street-level stairways would be added, the mezzanine area would be redesigned with additional turnstiles installed, and a new platform stairway will be built. Construction on the elevator and new street entrances started in 2017, and substantial completion is projected for November 2020.

          In addition, during the Canarsie Tubes shutdown, the Bedford Avenue station would serve as the western terminal of the L train, with one track in service at any given time due to the reconstruction of the tubes. There would be transfers to the L3 and L4 Select Bus Service routes to Manhattan (as well as the L14 SBS during late nights), and to a ferry route that connects to Stuyvesant Cove Park in Manhattan.</p>

          <p class="story">Bedford Avenue has experienced a surge in ridership along with the recent gentrification of Williamsburg. In the 1970s, the station had a fairly low annual ridership of 1.2 million, amounting to an average of 3,000 entries during weekdays. In 2000, there were 3,783,000 boardings recorded at the station, but after the neighborhood was re-zoned in 2005, the MTA noted even higher ridership. By 2007, ridership had increased over 50%, to 5,776,000 annual passengers. In 2008, Bedford Avenue was used by more than 6 million people, making it the 53rd most-used subway station in New York City and one of the busiest in Brooklyn. In 2017, approximately 9.6 million riders used this station.

          Growing passenger numbers along the L, partly influenced by Bedford Avenue station, have made the L train one of the most overcrowded in the system, a fact that has adverse effects on riders. In 2010, Bedford Avenue surpassed seven million entries for the first time in its history, receiving press for its particularly high weekend passenger volume. Crowding has become such an issue that politicians have called upon the MTA to "create a schedule that is more reflective of ridership patterns."

          </p>

          <p class="story">At platform level, Bedford Avenue utilizes a simple island platform setup with two tracks. The track normally used by southbound trains to Canarsie is labeled Q1, and the track normally used by northbound trains to Manhattan is labeled Q2. The Q- prefix denotes that the track is on the Canarsie Line, but this is only used by MTA officials and not by the general public. The Bedford Avenue station's walls have a brown-and-green mosaic pattern with geometric shapes and embellished "B" ornamentation.</p>
