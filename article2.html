        <section class="article_text">
          <p class="story"> It’s easy to spot this particular green space on the banks of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, because it’s the fancy swath of green space in front of the dilapidated yet beloved Domino Sugar Refinery building. The refinery, which dates back to 1856, was once the largest and most productive in the world.

          Completed in 2018, the five-acre public park, tucked in next to the Williamsburg Bridge on the East River, quickly became a favored summer playground for locals, thanks to its beach volleyball and bocce courts, dog run, fog fountain and 'flex field' – a playing field for daytime and nighttime sporting activities. (The row of wooden deck chairs positioned with stellar views of Manhattan also probably had something to do with it). You won’t go hungry either – chef Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group (Gramercy Tavern, Manhatta, among others) has opened the Mexican-themed Tacocina to keep the park’s revelers satiated.</p>

          <p class="story">The ongoing development at Brooklyn Bridge Park is nearing completion with the opening of the final pier to be converted to parkland, Pier 3. Similar to Domino Park, this green space is built for leisure and lounging, albeit with a slightly more artistic bent. Gazing out over Manhattan’s Financial District in one direction and Governor’s Island in the other, the park is home to a spacious central lawn, designed to be protected from the sun and wind by strategically placed groves of trees and hedges. Along with Adirondack chairs and picnic tables – most of which are moveable – Pier 3 also boasts its own interactive, exploratory labyrinth complete with a walk-in kaleidoscope, parabolic reflectors, dance chimes and an echo game, among other stimulating features.

          If you’re looking for something a little fancier than a picnic, the pier is also a short walk from the swanky eco-themed 1 Hotel Brooklyn, which opened in 2017 and houses restaurant The Osprey, as well as a cafe, 10th-floor cocktail lounge, and a rooftop garden and bar with some of the best views of lower Manhattan (sadly, the rooftop plunge pool is only open to hotel guests).

          </p>

          <p class="story">Over in Manhattan, a little farther up the East River, sits the Seaport District. This area is not only known for being New York City’s founding neighborhood (try strolling its streets without singing at least a few bars from Hamilton), but also for the recent opening of the impressive Pier 17.

          The sleek mixed-use structure is hard to miss – especially at night when it sets the waterfront aglow. Designed by SHoP Architects, Pier 17 incorporates restaurants, boutiques and pedestrian thoroughfares, along with a 1.5-acre rooftop (check out the Rooftop Concert Series in summer), complete with a restaurant and bar offering views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Lady Liberty herself.</p>
